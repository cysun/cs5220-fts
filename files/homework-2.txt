CS520 Spring 2007, Homework 2

Mailing Lists is a new component of CSNS which you will develop in this quarter.
In this assignment you are going to implement the "model" classes and database
access for this component, and your design should be based on the following
requirements:

* Any user can create mailing lists. The user who creates a mailing list
  becomes the owner of the mailing list, and is automatically subscribed
  to the list.
* A user can subscribe to any existing mailing list and become a subscriber
  of the mailing list.
* A subscriber of a mailing list may unsubscribe from a mailing list. The
  owner of the mailing list can unsubscribe any subscriber of the list except
  him or herself.
* A user can view existing mailing lists.
* Any subscriber of a mailing list can send messages to the mailing list.
  The message must be sent using CSNS, i.e. not using an external email client.
  The message will be mailed by CSNS to the subscribers of the mailing list,
  and a copy of the message will be saved in the database.
* A user may view the messages sent to a mailing list.
