CS520 Spring 2007, Homework 1

[Account] Send an email to csun@calstatela.edu and ask for account information
on the CS3 server. You have to be already enrolled in the class in order to get
an account. Note that the account includes a Subversion repository, and a copy
of the CSNS source code is already imported into the repository for you.

[Development Environment] Check out the CSNS source code from your Subversion
repository, and setup your development environment. Refer to the class notes,
but you don't have to follow them exactly, e.g. if you prefer NetBeans over
Eclipse. If you have any questions, post them in the class forum. To avoid
confusion, in the assignment descriptions I'll use CSNS (i.e. without hyperlink)
to refer to the project, and CSNS (i.e. with hyperlink) to refer to the server
where you submit your work.
