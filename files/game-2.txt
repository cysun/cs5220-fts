Re: Game Programming Class

we don't have a game program, and i don't think there ever will be. 350 and
450 were both cancelled the last two quarters. last quarter kang had to ease
up on the 560 prequisites to get enough students so that 560 wouldn't have to
be cancelled either. for some reason all the web classes are always packed
and all the theory courses get cancelled ha ha ha.

kang and akis both specialize in computer graphics. there are i think two grad 
tudents working with kang on game programming related thesis projects (none of
them were at the thesis presentations last monday though). so if you want to
do gamedev, make sure u get on kang's good side he he he Wink.
