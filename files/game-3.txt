Spider-Man 3 Review from GameSpot

Spider-Man 3 marks the fourth game from developer Treyarch to feature Marvel's
popular web-slinging superhero. So with Spider-Man 3 being the first game in
the series to hit the current generation of consoles, you might expect
something of a leap forward for the franchise--something to really wow
Spider-Man fans and take the series in a new and exciting direction.
No such luck, it seems. Spider-Man 3 is a lot like the last couple of
Spider-Man games. Sure, it throws in a few new wrinkles to the combat system
and adds some crazy God of War-esque contextual actions into the mix, but the
core game is functionally the same as previous Spider-Man games, and the
changes are a mixture of positive and problematic. Spider-Man 3 isn't
altogether bad, but it has enough issues to prevent it from being wholly
recommendable.
